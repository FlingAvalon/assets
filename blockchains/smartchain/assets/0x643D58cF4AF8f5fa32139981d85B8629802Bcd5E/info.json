    "description": "The Jax.Network blockchain houses two native digital currencies, JAX and JXN. As DeFi is run on Layer 2, there is a need to convert JAX and JXN into Wrapped JAX (WJAX) and Wrapped JXN (WJXN). WJXN-2 (Wrapped JXN) is a Layer-2 version of JXN, a native utility coin of the Jax.Network blockchain. Unlike WJXN, WJXN-2 can be divisible into smaller units and is mintable.",
